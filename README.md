# meatup-frontend

This frontend component was made in tandem with https://github.com/CChiu28/MeatUp-backend. It's written in
React via Vite, Typescript, and Tailwind with DaisyUI.

Similar to Yelp, it allows users to search for businesses via the Yelp API. Users are able to login in via Firebase,
which will allow users to chat with other users when viewing a business.
