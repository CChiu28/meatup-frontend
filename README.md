# meatup-frontend

This frontend component was made in tandem with [meatup-backend](https://github.com/CChiu28/MeatUp-backend). It's written in
React via Vite, Typescript, and Tailwind with DaisyUI.

Similar to Yelp, it allows users to search for businesses via the Yelp API. Users are able to login in via Firebase,
which will allow users to chat with other users when viewing a business.

## To run
Clone repo, and run `npm install` then `npm run dev` to start Vite
